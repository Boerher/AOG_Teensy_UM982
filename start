  UM982 Connection Instructions:
  - The Teensy 4.1 communicates with the UM982 GPS receiver to gather precision data for AgOpenGPS. 
  - UM982 provides heading, roll, and position data (latitude, longitude, and altitude).
  - Teensy pin assignments for the UM982 connection:
    * Teensy Serial 7 RX (Pin 28) -> UM982 TX1 (Sends position data from UM982 to Teensy).
    * Teensy Serial 7 TX (Pin 29) -> UM982 RX1 (Receives RTCM correction data from Teensy for RTK functionality).

  Additional Notes:
  - Serial communication between the Teensy and UM982 is set to 460800 baud for efficient data transfer.
  - The Teensy communicates with AgOpenGPS via USB or Ethernet, enabling real-time precision autosteer capabilities.

  Informative Summary:
  This program integrates the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller with the UM982 GPS receiver for high-accuracy GPS and IMU fusion.
  Key features include:
  - Real-time heading and roll data acquisition for autosteer.
  - RTK corrections sent to the UM982 for centimeter-level accuracy.
  - Compatibility with AgOpenGPS software through USB or Ethernet communication.
  - Integration with the BNO08x IMU for enhanced orientation and stability data.
  
  Serial Ports:
  - SerialAOG: Communicates with AgOpenGPS software over USB.
  - SerialRTK: Communicates with an RTK radio for correction data.
  - SerialGPS (Serial7): Handles data exchange with the UM982.

  Hardware Setup:
  - Ensure proper wiring between Teensy 4.1 and UM982 as per the connection plan.
  - For IMU functionality, connect the BNO08x module via I2C (SCL: Pin 19, SDA: Pin 18).
  - LEDs are used to indicate various system states such as GPS fix, IMU status, and Ethernet activity.
